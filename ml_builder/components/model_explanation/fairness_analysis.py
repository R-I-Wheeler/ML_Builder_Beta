    Determine if a column name represents a metric/score rather than a feature.
    
    This function filters out columns that appear to contain model evaluation metrics,
    scores, or calculated values that shouldn't be used for fairness analysis.
    Such columns are typically outputs or derivatives of model predictions.
    
    Args:
        col_name (str): The column name to evaluate
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the column appears to be a metric/score column, False otherwise
    
    Detection Logic:
        Checks if column name (case-insensitive) contains any of these keywords:
        - accuracy, precision, recall, f1
        - roc, auc (ROC curve related)  
        - error, loss, mse, mae, rmse (error metrics)
        - r2 (R-squared)
        - score, metric (generic score indicators)
    
    Examples:
        >>> is_metric_column('age')              # False - regular feature
        >>> is_metric_column('model_accuracy')   # True - contains 'accuracy'
        >>> is_metric_column('F1_Score')         # True - contains 'f1' and 'score'
        >>> is_metric_column('precision_weighted')  # True - contains 'precision'
        >>> is_metric_column('customer_score')   # True - contains 'score'
    
    Notes:
        - Used to automatically exclude metric columns from fairness analysis
        - Prevents circular analysis (using model outputs to evaluate model fairness)
        - Conservative approach: flags any column that might be a metric
        - Case-insensitive matching for robustness across naming conventions

    Create an intuitive Streamlit interface for selecting features to analyze for bias.
    
    This function renders a comprehensive UI that helps users select which features
    (protected attributes) to analyze for fairness. It provides smart defaults,
    explains feature characteristics, and warns about potential analysis issues.
    
    Args:
        valid_columns (list): List of column names eligible for fairness analysis
                             (excludes metric columns and other unsuitable features)
        protected_cols (list): Auto-detected protected attribute column names
                              (e.g., age, gender, race) found using pattern matching
        filtered_columns (list): Column names that were filtered out (e.g., metric columns)
                                to show users what was excluded and why
    
    Returns:
        list: Selected column names to analyze for fairness, or empty list if none selected
    
    UI Features:
        Smart Selection (Recommended):
            - Uses auto-detected protected attributes as defaults
            - Shows explanation of why each feature was selected
            - Displays feature characteristics and metadata
            
        Custom Selection:
            - For datasets ≤20 features: Visual checkbox interface with feature metadata
            - For larger datasets: Traditional multiselect with smart defaults
            - Groups features by type (categorical vs numeric)
            - Shows unique value counts and analysis suitability warnings
            
        Analyze All Features:
            - Selects all valid columns for comprehensive analysis
            - Warns about performance implications for large feature sets
    
    Smart Warnings and Recommendations:
        - Performance warnings for >15 features with option to limit
        - High-cardinality warnings for features with >20 unique values
        - Small group size warnings for groups with <10 samples  
        - Actionable recommendations for each type of issue detected
        
    UI Organization:
        1. Auto-detection results and excluded columns summary
        2. Selection method choice (Smart/Custom/All)
        3. Feature selection interface (varies by method)
        4. Analysis warnings and recommendations
        5. Final selection summary and validation
    
    Notes:
        - Accesses st.session_state.builder.X_test for feature analysis
        - All UI text includes helpful explanations and context
        - Provides educational content about fairness analysis

def analyse_model_fairness(X_test, y_test, predictions, columns_to_analyse, problem_type):
    """
    Analyze model fairness across protected attributes and demographic groups.
    
    This function performs comprehensive fairness analysis by calculating fairness metrics
    for each selected feature/attribute. It supports binary classification, multiclass 
    classification, and regression problems with different fairness measures for each.
    
    Args:
        X_test (pd.DataFrame): Test dataset features containing the protected attributes
        y_test (pd.Series or np.array): True target values for test dataset  
        predictions (np.array): Model predictions on test dataset
        columns_to_analyse (list): List of column names to analyze for bias/fairness
        problem_type (str): Type of ML problem - 'binary_classification', 
                           'multiclass_classification', or 'regression'
    
    Returns:
        dict: Comprehensive fairness analysis results containing:
            - success (bool): Whether analysis completed successfully
            - message (str): Error message if analysis failed
            - fairness_score (float): Overall fairness score (min across all features)
            - column_scores (dict): Individual fairness scores by feature
            - bias_detected (bool): Whether bias was detected in any feature
            - bias_types (list): List of bias descriptions for detected issues
            - recommendations (list): Actionable recommendations (empty in this function)
            - metric_frames (dict): Fairlearn MetricFrames for detailed analysis
            - feature_summaries (dict): Summary statistics for each analyzed feature
    
    Fairness Metrics by Problem Type:
        Binary Classification:
            - Demographic Parity: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
            - Equalized Odds: Equal true/false positive rates across groups
            - Overall Score: Minimum of the two above (stricter fairness standard)
            
        Multiclass Classification:
            - Demographic Parity: Equal prediction distributions across all classes
            - Accuracy Consistency: Similar accuracy across all groups
            - Overall Score: Minimum of the two above
            
        Regression:
            - Error Consistency: Similar Mean Absolute Error across groups
            - Overall Score: Ratio of best to worst group performance
    
    Notes:
        - Fairness scores range from 0 (completely unfair) to 1 (perfectly fair)
        - Scores >= 0.8 are generally considered acceptable
        - Scores < 0.6 indicate severe bias requiring immediate attention
        - Small sample sizes may produce unreliable results
        - Progress indicators are displayed during analysis for user feedback
    
    Raises:
        Does not raise exceptions - returns error information in result dict instead

    Generate specific, actionable recommendations for addressing detected bias.
    
    This function analyzes fairness results and generates targeted recommendations
    based on the type of bias detected, the problem type, and feature characteristics.
    Recommendations are prioritized by severity and include effort estimates.
    
    Args:
        fairness_results (dict): Results from analyse_model_fairness() containing
                               fairness scores and feature summaries
        X_test (pd.DataFrame): Test dataset features for analyzing group characteristics

                           'multiclass_classification', or 'regression')
    
    Returns:
        list: List of recommendation dictionaries, each containing:
            - feature (str): Name of the biased feature
            - issue (str): Description of the fairness issue detected
            - action (str): Specific recommended action to address the issue
            - priority (str): Priority level ('Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low')
            - effort (str): Estimated effort required ('Low', 'Medium', 'High')
    
    Recommendation Categories:
        Critical Priority:
            - Severe bias (score < 0.6) requiring immediate attention
            - Protected attribute violations with legal implications
            - Major demographic parity or equalized odds violations
            
        High Priority:
            - Moderate bias (score 0.6-0.8) that should be addressed
            - Small group sizes affecting statistical reliability
            - Protected attribute concerns with moderate impact
            
        Medium Priority:
            - High cardinality features needing data preprocessing
            - General fairness improvements for multiclass models
            - Feature engineering suggestions for better fairness
    
    Effort Estimates:
        Low: Data preprocessing, feature grouping, documentation
        Medium: Model retraining, fairness constraints, threshold tuning
        High: Data collection, new model architectures, major system changes
    
    Notes:
        - Only generates recommendations for features with scores < FAIRNESS_THRESHOLD

                   - Focus on recall and F1 score differences

                   - Precision is often more important
                   - But still check for fairness in recall
                   - False positive rates should be similar across groups

            ### 🤔 What is Model Fairness for Multiclass Classification?
            
            Model fairness ensures your model treats all groups fairly across **all classes** without discrimination. 
            For multiclass models, fairness is more complex because we need to ensure:
            
            - **Equal representation**: All groups have similar prediction distributions across all classes
            - **Consistent accuracy**: All groups receive predictions of similar quality
            - **No systematic bias**: No group is consistently favored or disadvantaged for any particular class
            
            **Example**: In a medical diagnosis model predicting 3 conditions (Healthy, Condition A, Condition B), 
            fairness means that patients from different demographic groups have:
            - Similar chances of being diagnosed with each condition (when appropriate)
            - Similar diagnostic accuracy across all conditions
            
            This analysis helps you identify potential bias and provides actionable recommendations.

            ## Fairness Metrics for Multiclass Classification
            
            Since your model predicts multiple classes, we use specialized fairness measures:
            
            ### 🎯 **Demographic Parity**
            - **What it measures**: Whether all groups have similar prediction distributions across all classes
            - **Why it matters**: Ensures no group is systematically over- or under-represented in any class
            - **Example**: In a hiring model with outcomes (Reject, Interview, Hire), demographic parity ensures that the percentage of each outcome is similar across demographic groups
            
            ### 📊 **Accuracy Consistency** 
            - **What it measures**: Whether all groups receive predictions of similar quality
            - **Why it matters**: Ensures no group gets systematically worse predictions
            - **Calculation**: Ratio of minimum group accuracy to maximum group accuracy
            - **Example**: If Group A has 85% accuracy and Group B has 90% accuracy, consistency = 0.94
            
            ### 🎯 **Overall Fairness Score**
            - Takes the minimum of Demographic Parity and Accuracy Consistency
            - **Score ≥ 0.8**: Generally considered fair
            - **Score < 0.8**: May indicate bias requiring attention
            
            ### ⚠️ **Why we don't use traditional binary fairness metrics**:
            - **False Positive/Negative Rates**: Don't directly apply to multiclass (which "positive" class?)
            - **Equalized Odds**: Designed for binary outcomes
            - **ROC-AUC**: Requires probability scores, complex for multiclass

        ### 💡 **General Interpretation Guidelines**
        
        - **Scores near 1.0**: Excellent fairness
        - **Scores 0.8-0.9**: Good fairness, acceptable for most applications
        - **Scores 0.6-0.8**: Moderate bias, should be investigated
        - **Scores below 0.6**: Significant bias, requires immediate attention
        
        Remember: Perfect fairness (score = 1.0) is rare in real-world data. The key is understanding 
        whether observed differences are acceptable for your specific use case and legal/ethical requirements.
