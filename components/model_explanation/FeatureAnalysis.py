                    This plot shows **how each feature affects predictions** across all samples:

                    **Understanding the Plot:**
                    - **Y-axis**: Features ranked by importance (most important at top)
                    - **X-axis**: SHAP value (impact on prediction)
                      - Positive values → Push prediction higher
                      - Negative values → Push prediction lower
                    - **Each dot**: Represents one sample from your data
                    - **Color**: Shows the feature's actual value
                      - 🔴 Red/Pink = High feature values
                      - 🔵 Blue = Low feature values
                    
                    **🔍 Interactive Features:**
                    - **Hover**: See detailed info (feature value, SHAP value, sample #)
                    - **Zoom**: Drag to select an area to zoom in
                    - **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
                    - **Reset**: Double-click to reset the view
                    - **Controls**: Use the ⚙️ Customize Plot section to:
                      - Change number of features shown
                      - Select specific features
                      - Download raw SHAP data
                    
                    **What to Look For:**
                    
                    1. **Feature Importance**: Features at the top matter most
                    
                    2. **Impact Direction**: 
                       - Dots mostly on the right = feature increases predictions
                       - Dots mostly on the left = feature decreases predictions
                       - Dots on both sides = feature effect varies by context
                    
                    3. **Value-Impact Relationship**:
                       - Red dots on right + Blue dots on left = Higher values increase prediction
                       - Red dots on left + Blue dots on right = Higher values decrease prediction
                       - Mixed colors = Complex non-linear relationship
                    
                    4. **Spread**: Wide spread = feature has varying effects across samples

                #### What are SHAP Values?
                SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help us understand how each feature in your data influences your model's predictions. Think of them as a way to "score" each feature's contribution to a prediction.

                Key points about SHAP values:
                - They are based on game theory concepts
                - They provide both local (individual prediction) and global (overall model) explanations
                - They are consistent and mathematically fair in attributing feature importance
                - The values can be positive or negative, showing whether a feature increases or decreases predictions

                #### Feature Importance Based on SHAP Values
                When we talk about feature importance using SHAP values:

                1. **Mean Absolute SHAP Value**
                - We take the absolute value of SHAP values for each feature
                - Average these values across all predictions
                - Higher values = More important features

                2. **Interpretation**
                - Features with larger SHAP values have stronger impact on predictions
                - The ranking shows which features are most influential in your model
                - Both positive and negative impacts are considered equally important

                #### 💡 Real-World Example
                Imagine predicting house prices:
                - A SHAP value of 50,000 for 'square_footage' means this feature alone pushes the prediction up by $50,000
                - A SHAP value of -20,000 for 'age' means this feature reduces the predicted price by $20,000
                - The absolute importance doesn't care about direction, just magnitude of impact

                #### Why SHAP Values Matter
                - They provide transparent, interpretable model explanations
                - Help identify which features drive your model's decisions
                - Useful for model debugging and improvement
                - Essential for explaining predictions to stakeholders

                    ALE plots help you understand how each feature affects your model's predictions. Think of them like a 
                    "what-if" analysis that shows how changing a feature's value impacts the prediction.
                    
                    🎯 **What Makes ALE Special:**
                    - Shows how predictions change at different feature values
                    - Better at handling complex relationships
                    
                    📊 **How to Read These Plots:**
                    - **X-axis**: The values of your feature
                    - **Y-axis**: How much the prediction changes
                    - **Line**: Shows the effect at each value
                        - Going up = feature increases the prediction
                        - Going down = feature decreases the prediction
                        - Flat = feature has little effect in that range
                    
                    🔍 **Real-World Example:**
                    Imagine predicting house prices based on size:
                    - Upward slope: Bigger houses → Higher prices
                    - Flat line: Size stops mattering after a certain point
                    - Downward slope: Too big might lower price in some areas

                - What it does: Controls how many data points to use
                - Higher numbers = More precise but slower
                - Lower numbers = Faster but less precise
                - Recommended: Start with 5000 and adjust if needed

                - What it does: Groups similar values together
                - More bins = More detailed but might be noisier
                - Fewer bins = Smoother but might miss details

                💡 **Tips for Best Results:**
                - For quick exploration: Use smaller sample size

                **Tree-based models that support visualization:**
                - **Single Decision Trees**: Show the complete decision logic
                - **Random Forest**: View individual trees from the ensemble
                - **Gradient Boosting**: Explore sequential tree improvements
                - **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Examine boosted tree structures
                
                **Why decision trees are valuable for feature analysis:**
                - Show exact decision boundaries
                - Reveal feature interaction patterns
                - Provide interpretable business rules
                - Help identify the most important decision points
